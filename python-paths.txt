Terminal commands

1. python

2. python3

3. which python3

4. type python3

5. echo $PATH

/home/welcome/.nvm/versions/node/v18.7.0/bin:
/home/welcome/.local/bin:
/usr/local/sbin:
/usr/local/bin:
/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:
/sbin:/bin:
/usr/games:
/usr/local/games:
/snap/bin

Relative vs Absolute paths : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqX6hu7oEew
	path: address;location

	relative : specify location relative to current directory

	absolute: specify the entire path through directory hierarchy
		~/home/welcome

export PATH=~/anaconda3/bin:$PATH

echo $PATH
/home/welcome/anaconda3/bin:
/home/welcome/anaconda3/condabin:
/home/welcome/.nvm/versions/node/v18.7.0/bin:
/home/welcome/.local/bin:
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:
/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:
/usr/games:/usr/local/games:
/snap/bin

	I chose ~/anaconda3/bin/python3 , working
	If I cd into /home/welcome/.nvm/versions/node/v18.7.0/bin 
	and then python	here works 

sudo -i
	asked for password and came to root

	1. Now, manually add a directory to the path

	if we gedit ~/.bashrc 
	and paste
	
	this will reset the entire PATH variable to this one single directory
	we dont want this to happen

	instead we want to add this directory to our current PATH variable
	also we want the directory to be seen first before any directory
	:$PATH" does that.
	Here is what we got to do
	gedit ~/.bashrc
	and paste
	PATH="/home/welcome/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"
	export PATH

Q. Which python exectuable are we currently using
A. 	python
	import sys
	sys.executable
	exit()

	sys module is a build-in module in the standard library

Important Notes: 

we have pip installed a package, but when we try to import the package, 
it doesnot work. This can also be a path issue . python and pip are two 	separate commands and therefore can be located in two different places.
So if the path is messed up, it is entirely possible that what we install 		with pip isn't installing that package with the version of python that we 		think it is installing it for.
 
	For example: Let us say we want to install django
	command : pip install django
		      pip show django - this will show more details like where is the 				  package installed and so on.
			  django location from this above command: 
			  /home/welcome/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages

	 Now carefully look at the location where the module is installed using sys 
	 command: python
		      import sys
			  sys.executable
 	 output: '/usr/bin/python3'

	 Not the same. 

IQ. Command line is using the correct version of python but the editor like sublime text is not. Why?
A: For sublime text, the executable can be set using build systems, check Sir Corey's idea.
For me it is VS Code
